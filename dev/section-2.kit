                    <p>In CSS, the term Box Model is used when talking about design and layouts. It is essentially a box that wraps around all HTML elements and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. When you define a width and a height for your box using CSS, you are defining not the entire area taken up by the content, padding, border and margin. You are actually just defining the content area itself - the bit right in the middle.</p>
